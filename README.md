 practical interview with Accendero Software


As a heads up to the individual reviewing this, the main code to accomplish this task is in the webpages folder in the mainpage.html. A server was attempted, but I was not able to accomplish the task within the time constraints given with that method.


I assume when persistent state was requested it was meaning a website that did not need to refresh when information was saved/stored. I attempted to look into AJAX, however, I did not have time to make it work with my server as currently set up. THis is why I went with localStorage, as it does this, though sadly not on a more "permanent" level that a server/DB could provide.
